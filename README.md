## 💎 The Vision
**VORA is an ultra-premium e-commerce boutique disguised as a futuristic design laboratory.**

It aims to redefine web elegance by merging mechanical precision with aesthetic void. It serves not just as a store, but as a digital gallery where every interaction is designed to feel weightless, exclusive, and cinematic.

- **Living Background:** A sophisticated background layer featuring subtle dot-grids and moving "auras" to create depth.
- **Advanced Animations:** Complex scroll-triggered effects and physics-based interactions using `Framer Motion`.
- **Interactive Mechanics:** Real-time clipboard interactions, encrypted email feedback, and toast notifications.
- **Modern Stack:** Tailwind CSS v4 (the future of CSS) and Vite for instant performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** ReactJS, Lucide Icons.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, custom glassmorphism shaders.
- **Motion:** Framer Motion (useScroll, useTransform, AnimatePresence).
- **FX:** Canvas-Confetti for successful conversion feedback.
